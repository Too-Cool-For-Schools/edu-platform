# Module 01 — Thinking Like a System

## Objective
Learn how to break tasks into Input → Process → Output for automation.

## What You’ll Learn
- How to think like a systems operator
- Why planning beats coding first
- Basic Python concepts (variables, logic)

## Lesson Content

Every automation follows this pattern:
 Input — the raw data or task
2. Process — the logic to handle it
3. Output — the result you want

**Example:** 
Task: Calculate total revenue from sales data.

- Input: `sales.csv`
- Process: sum the "revenue" column
- Output: total revenue number

### Pro Tip:
Before touching code, write down the steps in plain language. This is the key to thinking like a programmer without being a programmer.
